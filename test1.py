# 1. String Manipulation: Reverse Words in a Sentence
# Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input, and reverses the order of the words in the sentence.
# Example:
# Input: "Python is fun"
# Output: "fun is Python"
# mystr = "Python is fun"
# myList = mystr.split(' ')
# print(myList)
# temp = myList[0]
# myList[0] = myList[-1]
# myList[-1] =temp
# print(myList)
# mystr = ' '.join(myList)
# print(mystr)



# 2. List Operations: Find the Maximum and Minimum
# Write a Python program that takes a list of integers and returns both the maximum and minimum values from the list.
# Example:
# Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
# Output: Max: 9, Min: 1

# 3. Tuple Operations: Count Occurrences of Elements
# Write a Python program that takes a tuple of numbers and counts the number of occurrences of each number.
# Example:
# Input: (1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1)
# Output: {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}

# myTuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1)
# mySet = set(myTuple)
# myDict = {}
# k=0
# for i in mySet:
#     myDict[i] = myTuple.count(i)
#     # myDict.update({i:myTuple.count(i)})
#     k+=1
#     print(k)

# print(myDict)
